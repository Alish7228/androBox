# 3in1ProotX86Emus
Exagear, box64 and box86 in the same proot rootfs. Already configured and ready to use. Pretty much a WIP, expect bugs and some broken features

# Requirments

An Android phone, Termux from F-Droid and Termux:X11 app alongside its deb installed which you can download from Termux:X11 github action page.

# Installation

Download the rootfs from link sections and move it to the root of your Internal Storage. Copy paste this command in Termux:

curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pipetto-crypto/3in1ProotX86Emus/master/setup.sh -o setup.sh && bash setup.sh

Once installation is completed, to access the proot you can type this command:

ubuntu or ubuntu -x in case you want to start Termux:X11 server alongside it

For non Adreno users that want to have GPU acceleration, they need to append the -va flag at the end of the second command.

To update the proot launcher script, it's possible to use the update argument:

ubuntu update

#Tips

After you login, the first thing I recommend to do is to update all the scripts with update-bins command, which needs to be run twice. Then if you plan to run Windows apps you are going to need to download wine. This can be done with wineswitch command. Optionally, you can install InputBridge with install_ib and DXVK if your phone has a Turnip compatible GPU with install_dxvk. Eventually, if you would rather use GPU acceleration instead of software, you need to switch GPU renderer with gpuswitch zink or gpuswitch virgl based on your SoC. If you see a black screen when you start Termux:X11 the first time, don't panic as this is totally normal because this program doesn't have any GUI option yet. You need to run every program from command line unless you know how to install a DE. I have already prepared helper scripts to get Wine Desktop or install a DE, when they drop in you can just use update command to download them in the proot.


# Useful Proot commands

wineswitch - Allow to switch between different wine versions

update - Update all the scripts inside the proot, you will need to re-execute wineswitch and install_dxvk every time you update

install_dxvk - Install DXVK in all available wineprefixes, only for Turnip compatible Adreno GPUs

remove_dxvk - Remove DXVK from all available wineprefixes

install_ib - Install InputBridge in all available wineprefixes, for both 32 and 64 bit

exawine - Run a Windows program through exagear

exawineswitch - Switch wine version for exagear

gpuswitch - Switch gpu renderer, only for box86/64. Exagear only runs on turnip+zink or dxvk for now

install_winege - Install Proton for Lutris, not recommended as it is unstable on Android

winege - Run a Windows program through Proton for Lutris

wine64 - Run a Windows x86_64 program through box64

wine - Run a Windows x86 program through box86

More to come in the nearby future
