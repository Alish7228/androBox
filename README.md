# androBox

androBox is a x86 emulator using Termux, Box86 and Box64. Unlikely similiar projects, this one runs completely natively on Android without chroot/proot resulting in greater speed, all thanks to Glibc-for-Termux project.

# Requirments

An Android phone preferably running Android 10 or newer, Termux from F-Droid  and Termux-X11 apk.

# Install
